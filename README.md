# Gabriel Eidelman

Hi, I'm Gabriel! I'm a Computer Science student at Stanford University and currently working at AG2. 

In my free time I love to play chess - I'm a Fide Master ranked top 10 in the U.S. for my age, and I took a gap year to play and travel through Europe after graduating high school.
