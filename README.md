# Gabriel Eidelman

👋 Hi, I'm Gabriel! I'm a Computer Science student at Stanford University and an experienced full stack developer. I'm passionate about building thoughtful, user-focused tools — especially ones that blend data, design, and real-world behavior. Always open to learning something new or collaborating on cool ideas! 

In my free time I love to play chess - I'm a Fide Master ranked top 10 in the U.S. for my age, and I took a gap year to play and travel through Europe after graduating high school.
